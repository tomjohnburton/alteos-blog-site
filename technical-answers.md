# 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent about 13 hours on the coding challenge. I would have really liked to include a working Docker configuration. Although I developed a basic understanding of the concepts behind docker, I was not able to fully implement it.

# 2. Why did you choose the language you used for the coding test?

NodeJS is the backend language I learnt at the Ironhack bootcamp. Also it makes life so much easier when building the entire application in JavaScript.

# 3. Did you learn anything new while solving this challenge?

I learnt how to use Redux in partnership with my backend which was immensely satisfying. Also I learnt how to unit test api end points.
