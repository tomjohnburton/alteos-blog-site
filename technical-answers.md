# 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent about 13 hours on the coding challenge. I would really like to add a deployment using kubernetes.

# 2. Why did you choose the language you used for the coding test?

NodeJS is the backend language I learnt at the Ironhack bootcamp. Also it makes life so much easier when building the entire application in JavaScript. I used React for the front end because it was much easier to create a simple interface for me to perform tests. Also the host of packages available to assist with things like encryption etc. is so readily available and easy to use.

# 3. Did you learn anything new while solving this challenge?

I learnt how to use Redux in partnership with my backend which was immensely satisfying. Also I learnt how to unit test api end points. I learnt the basics of docker and how to set up a docker-compose file and a Dockerfile.
