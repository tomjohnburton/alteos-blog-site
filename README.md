## About the app

The client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the server (in Node/Express).

## How to run the client

Open up two terminal instances and from the root directory run the following

```
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

## How to run the server

Open up two terminal instances and from the root directory run the following

```
cd server/
npm i
npm start
```

## Check if they are connected

1. With the two apps running, open your browser in http://localhost:3000/.
2. If you see a webpage saying `Welcome to React`, it means the FrontEnd is working.
3. If the same webpage has the phrase `API is working properly`, it means the API is working.
4. Enjoy!
